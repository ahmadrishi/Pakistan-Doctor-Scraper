A qualified clinical supervisor, clinical psychologist, psychotherapist, and trained addiction therapist. I’m associated with different institutes which include CPPD CIC as a Clinical Supervisor. Working part-time as a Counselor at Habib University. Provides counseling services to a diverse range of populations through Saaya Health service as well as doing my private practice also. I’m internationally qualified in Addiction, EMDR, and NLP approach. My specialties lie in psychotherapy, humanistic integrative therapy, Internal Family System (IFS), art therapy, play therapy, EMDR, NLP, Motivational Interviewing, TFCBT, Gestalt, inner child, and Trauma Work. I did my Master of Science in Clinical Psychology from the Institute of Professional Psychology, Bahria University Karachi Campus, and 
completed my Bachelor in Professional Psychology from the same Institute. I believe that a great deal of healing arises from a wounded self. The empathetic self creates profound healing. When we courageously explore our pain, we become more insightful and more awake to the essential qualities of the healer. The wound becomes our gift and that’s how we can create a healthy support group that’s my source of inspiration and the aim of therapy.","Depression
